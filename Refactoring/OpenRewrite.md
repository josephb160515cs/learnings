# Open Rewrite

## Introduction

OpenRewrite is a tool for automatically refactoring source code, helping developers quickly reduce technical debt. It provides pre-built refactoring recipes for tasks like framework migrations, security updates, and code style consistency, cutting down work time from hours to minutes. Plugins for build tools like Gradle and Maven allow running these recipes on individual repositories. While it started with Java, the OpenRewrite community is expanding to support more languages and frameworks, making software easier to update and secure.
