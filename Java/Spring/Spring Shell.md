# Spring Shell

## Introduction
**Spring Shell** is a Spring-based framework that allows developers to create interactive command-line applications with ease. It provides a way to define custom commands that can be executed from the terminal, making it useful for building CLI (Command Line Interface) tools. Spring Shell is commonly used to build developer tools, administration consoles, and interactive shells for applications.

### Key Features of Spring Shell:
1. **Command Creation**: You can define custom commands with annotations like `@ShellMethod`, and Spring Shell will handle parsing and execution.

2. **Input Parsing**: It automatically parses user input and maps it to method parameters in your commands.

3. **Auto-completion**: It supports tab completion for commands and arguments, making it user-friendly for interactive shell applications.

4. **Integration with Spring**: Since it's built on top of the Spring framework, it can easily integrate with other Spring components like dependency injection, Spring Boot, etc.

5. **Customizable Shell**: You can customize the shell's prompt, history, and more to fit your application's needs.
