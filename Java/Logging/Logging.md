# Logging

## SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade For Java)
## Reasons to choose SLF4J over Log4j

*  Abstraction & Decouples from underlying implementation
* No code change required if we want to change the underlying logging f/w
* SLF4J is more performant for applications with high throughput
* Community support is very strong for SLF4J
