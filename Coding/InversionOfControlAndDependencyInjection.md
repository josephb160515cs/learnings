# Inversion Of Control and Dependency Injection

## Inversion of Control (IoC)

It is the priciple in software engineering by which control of some portion or piece of code is given to the underlying f/ws.
In Spring Framework ApplicationContext is the IoC.

### Adavantages of Using IoC

* Reduces coupling
* Greater Ease in testing since one component can be mocked.

## Dependency Injection

"It is pattern we can use to implement IoC, where the control being inverted is setting an object's dependencies". Dependency Injection can be done by injecting a dependency through the constructor, setter and Field based injection
