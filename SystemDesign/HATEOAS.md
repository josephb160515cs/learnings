# HATEOAS
HATEOAS, which stands for Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State, is a concept in the field of web architecture and design. In layman's terms, it's a way of organizing and designing web applications to make them more intuitive and self-explanatory for both users and developers.

Imagine you're interacting with a website, and instead of just getting data in response to your requests, you also receive links or references to related actions you can take. HATEOAS extends this idea to web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). In a HATEOAS-enabled API, when you request information from a server, the server not only sends back the data you asked for but also includes links or references to other resources and actions that are relevant or possible based on the current state of the application.

It's like navigating a website where every page not only gives you information but also provides links to other pages or actions you can perform. This makes the application more self-discoverable, as the client (e.g., a web browser or a mobile app) doesn't need to have prior knowledge of all possible actions or resources. Instead, it can navigate and interact with the application dynamically based on the information provided by the server.

In essence, HATEOAS simplifies interactions by allowing the server to guide the client on what it can do next, reducing the need for the client to have a fixed set of instructions in advance.
