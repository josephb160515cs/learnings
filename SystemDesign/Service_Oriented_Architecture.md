# Service Oriented Architecture

## Introduction
It is the style of architecture which is used to build applications which deliver services to other applications over protcol.

Note : SOA and micro-services architecture are different

## Enterpise Service Bus (ESB)
"An ESB, or enterprise service bus, is an architectural pattern whereby a centralized software component performs integrations between applications.  It performs transformations of data models, handles connectivity, performs message routing, converts communication protocols and potentially manages the composition of multiple requests. The ESB can make these integrations and transformations available as a service interface for reuse by new applications. " - IBM

## Advantages of using SOA
* Can build reusable services
* Loose coupling between services

## Disadvantages of using SOA
* Maintenance cost is high
* ESB can be single point of failure
* It becomes complex to implement
