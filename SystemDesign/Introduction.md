# Introduction   to System Design

## Design Principles
* DRY - Do not Repeat Yourself. This principle aims to reduce code repetition across the entire project.

* KISS - Keep It Simple, Stupid. This design principle asks us to keep the designs should be as simple as possible.

* YAGNI - You Ain't Gonna Need It. This design principle says to features should be added only when required . This principle asks to take things step by step.

### KISS vs YAGNI
* KISS is about keeping reducing unnecessary complexity whereas YAGNI is about cuting off unrequired features.

## Functional Requirements

It is the description of the different functionality or services offered by the application.

eg. List all the items in the cart  is one of the functional requirements of the e-commerce website.

## Non-Functionional Requirements

It is the diffferent -ilities possess by the system such as 

* ### Usablilty
 How easy a system must be to use.

* ### Scalability
The ablilty to handle huge amounts of request without degrading performance.

* ### Efficiency
The time taken for different actions . The latency of the system.

* ### Reliability
How well the system can recover in case of errors.

* ### Availability
Determines how long the system can be maximum unavailable for customers.

* ### Maintainability
"A maintainable system must be capable of being maintained cost-effectively over its expected lifetime"

## Different Types of architecture 

* ### Monolithic Architecture

* ### N-Layered Architecture

* ### Micro-services Architecture
