# Postgres

## Performance Improvement

* Create parition in table
* `uuid_generate_v4()` over `gen_random_uuid()`

## Materialized Views
1. **Materialized Views**: Materialized views are a feature in PostgreSQL that allow you to pre-compute and store the results of complex, resource-intensive queries as tables. This can significantly improve query performance for analytics on large volumes of data.

2. **Limitations of Materialized Views**:
    - **Inefficient Refreshes**: When refreshing a materialized view, the entire dataset is recomputed, making refreshes computationally expensive and slow.
    - **Manual Refreshes**: Materialized views do not automatically update with new data; they require manual refreshes using the `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` command.
    - **Out-of-Date Results**: Materialized views may not include the latest data, resulting in out-of-date results.

3. **Continuous Aggregates**: TimescaleDB, an extension for PostgreSQL, introduces "continuous aggregates" as an enhancement to materialized views for real-time analytics. Continuous aggregates offer the following advantages:
    - **Automatic Refreshes**: You can define a refresh policy for continuous aggregates, and they are automatically and efficiently updated at specified intervals.
    - **Efficient Refresh Process**: Continuous aggregates update only the data that has changed since the last refresh, making the refresh process more efficient.
    - **Up-to-Date Results**: Continuous aggregates combine materialized data with new, not-yet-materialized data to provide up-to-date results.

4. **Usage Example**: The article provides an example of using continuous aggregates to power a real-time dashboard for a transportation agency. It shows how to create continuous aggregates with refresh policies to provide live, daily, and weekly overviews of key metrics.

5. **Hierarchical Continuous Aggregates**: TimescaleDB also introduces hierarchical continuous aggregates, which allow you to create continuous aggregates on top of other continuous aggregates, making the process even more efficient.

6. **Conclusion**: The article concludes that while PostgreSQL was not originally designed for applications that require processing large live datasets, materialized views are a powerful feature for improving query performance. However, they have limitations, and TimescaleDB's continuous aggregates address these limitations by providing automated, efficient, and up-to-date solutions for real-time analytics.
